### Create Collection

**Can we select a specific page while selecting a report?**
  - **Yes**, while selecting a report, the dropdown arrow next to the report name will open all the pages. You can untick the pages you don't need.  

**How do I apply a User Action?**
  - After selecting the report, click the dropdown next to the report name. Then you will see the **+** icon in the user action column; you can add a user action from there.

**Why is the User Action button disabled in an RLS-enabled report, and how can I apply a User Action?**  
  - If you've selected an **RLS-enabled report**, the **User Action** button will be disabled until you **configure RLS** details. Once RLS details are configured, you can click the dropdown arrow next to the report name to see the **+** icon and add a User Action.

**What should I enter in Role Name and Role Email while configuring RLS?**
  - In **Role Name**, select the specified role. In **Role Email ID**, if you have admin permissions, enter the email of the user on whose behalf you want to view the report; otherwise, your own email will be auto-filled.

**What access levels can be assigned to collaborators?**
  - You can assign **Editor** or **Viewer** level access to the collaborator.

### Edit Collection

**Can I delete a collection?**
  - **No**, currently you can't delete a collection.

**Can I edit a collection?**
  - **Yes**, on the collection you will see ![Edit Icon](attachment/edit-icon.png). Click on it to edit the collection.

**Can I change collaborators after creating a collection?**
  - **Yes**, you can **add/remove** any collaborator.

**Can I change the report after creating a collection?**
  - **Yes**, if you *haven't created a test run*, you can change the report.

### Main Page

**How can I find an old collection?**
  - Using **Search Bar** and **Filters**, you can easily find the collection.

**How can I see only the collections I created?** 
  - In **My Collection**, you will see the collections you created.

**Can I see collections in both simple and detailed view?**
  - **Yes**, using **Table View** and **Tile View**, you will be able to see both the detailed and simple views of collections.

**How do I sign out?**
  - In the **Header** at the top-right corner, you will find the User Settings icon. Click on it to see the **Sign Out** button.

### Create Test

**Why can't I switch 'Apply to all' / 'Percentage split' even after entering the user count?**
  - **Deselect** the current option before choosing another one.

**When should I use 'Apply to all' and when should I use 'Percentage split'?**
  - Use **Apply to all** when you want to assign the specified load count to each page.
  - Use **Percentage split** when you want to divide the user count across the report based on specified percentages.

**What does 'Total Load Testing Count' mean?**
  - It means the **total number of virtual machines** you want to simulate in the test run.

**What does 'Total Percentage Count: Effective' mean?**
  - It represents the **calculated distribution** of user load across clusters, based on the **percentage values** you’ve entered for each. It should be *100* to create a test run.

**I clicked the Trigger button, but nothing happened. Why?**
  - If you see a **triggered successful** toast, it will *display the result after some time*. Just refresh the page using ![Refresh Icon](attachment/refresh.png); otherwise, check the cluster from admin settings.

**Why is the Trigger button disabled?**
  - Either you have only **Viewer** access or the **Clusters** are off; start the cluster from admin settings.

**What does 'Partially Passed' mean?**
  - It means *few pages* of the report **failed**.

### Admin Settings

**How can I check the status of a cluster?**
  - Go to **Admin Settings**. Below the selected cluster, you will find the status of the cluster.

**How can I start or stop a cluster?**
  - Go to **Admin Settings > Cluster Management**, select management type **Manual**, and toggle the **ON/OFF** button.

**Why isn't the cluster starting after selecting 'Auto'?**
  - In **Auto**, the cluster only gets **stopped** after the specified hours. To start the cluster, you have to **manually** start it.

**Can anyone start/stop the same cluster?**
  - **No**, only the admin can start/stop the cluster.

### Insight Report

**Why is nothing visible in my Insight Report?**
Most likely, you haven't selected the Collection or there is an issue in the configuration.
