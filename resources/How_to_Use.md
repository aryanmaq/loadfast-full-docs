### Create Test Run
Creating a test run in LoadFAST allows you to simulate user activity and measure the performance of your reports by specifying the load count. This helps in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing report load times.

**Steps:**

1. **Enter Collection’s Detail Page**

    - Click on created collection to enter detail page.
    
      <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/coll-click.png" alt="Enter Collection detailed Page"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. **Click on + New Test:**
    - On your collection’s detail page, click the **+ New Test** button to start creating a new test run.
  
      <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/coll-create-test.png" alt="Create Test Run"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. **Select Load Test:** Enter the desired user count. 

     <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/test-type.png" alt="Enter Test Details"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. **Enter Test Details:**

   - Provide a name for your test in the **Test Name** field.
   - Configure the number of users (load count) to simulate for the test run.
   - Use options "Apply to All" or "Percentage Split" to distribute users across assets.
     - **Apply to All:** Equally distribute user count to all reports
        **Example:** If you enter 5 users, each page of every report will receive 5 users. For instance:
         - "FinancialReport" has 2 pages, so it will receive 2 × 5 = 10 users.
         - "Retail Analysis" has 4 pages, so it will receive 4 × 5 = 20 users.
         - The total load count will be calculated as 10 + 20 = 30 users.
         
         <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/test-apply-all.png" alt="Apply to All option"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
     
     - **Percentage Split:** Customizable distribute user count to all reports
     **Example:** If you enter 10 users and allocate percentages as follows:
         - "FinancialReport" is assigned 20%, so it will receive 10 × 20% = 2 users.
         - "Retail Analysis" is assigned 80%, so it will receive 10 × 80% = 8 users.
         - The total load count will be distributed as per the specified percentages.
         
         **Note:** Ensure the "Total Percentage Count: Effective" is 100.
         
         
         <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/test-per-split.png" alt="Percentage Split option"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
   
   - After entering the test details, click **Save Test** to proceed.
   
     <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/test-enter-detail.png" alt="Enter Test Details"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. **Review and Trigger Test Run:**

   - Your test run will appear within the collection.
   - Click the **Trigger** button to initiate the test run.
      - It will calculate the Average Page Load Time (Avg PLT) and the 90th percentile, updating the Run Status based on the specified Load Count.
      
      <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/test-created.png" alt="Created Test"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. **Monitor Test Progress and Results:**

   - Metrics such as average PLT, 90th Percentile, and run status will be displayed for each test run:
     - **Run Status:** Indicates the current state of the test run (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Partially Passed, Completed, Failed).
       - **Partially Passed:** Indicates that some pages in the report passed the test, while others failed.
       - **Failed:** Indicates that there is an issue with the report. Hovering over the "Failed" status of a particular run displays a pop-up box with details about the issue.
     - **Average PLT (Page Load Time):** Shows the average time taken for report pages to load during the test run.
     - **90th Percentile:** Represents the page load time below which 90% of the test results fall. This helps identify outliers and gives a realistic view of user experience.
   - Click on the **+** icon to the left of the created test run name to expand and view all the triggered runs for that Test Run, including their individual statuses and metrics.
   
     <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/attachment/test-triggered-res.png" alt="Test Results"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
